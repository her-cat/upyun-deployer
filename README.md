## Example usage

```yml
name: Deploy to UpYun

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout Repository master branch
        uses: actions/checkout@master

      - name: Setup Hugo
        uses: peaceiris/actions-hugo@v2
        with:
          hugo-version: '0.101.0'

      - name: Build static files
        run: hugo --minify --environment production

      - name: Deploy
        uses: her-cat/upyun-deployer@v1
        with:
          bucket: ${{ secrets.UPYUN_BUCKET }}
          operator: ${{ secrets.UPYUN_OPERATOR_NAME }}
          password: ${{ secrets.UPYUN_OPERATOR_PWD }}
          dir: public
```

Before use, you need to configure `Actions secrets` in the repository settings. The static files generated by hugo are saved in the public directory by default, so here `dir` is set to `public`.
